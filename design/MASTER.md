# NeuralNetUI Design Language

## Principles

- Keep the chat itself visually dominant; controls should stay compact and quiet until needed.
- Use the dark neutral surface with restrained blue accents already established by the application.
- Reveal dense technical information progressively through clear, keyboard-accessible disclosure controls.
- Preserve readable vertical stacks on mobile and never require horizontal page scrolling.

## Tool activity

- Group all tool calls from one assistant message under one top-level disclosure with a wrench icon and aggregate state.
- Show every call as a subordinate disclosure with a tool-specific icon and localized active, completed, or error wording.
- Keep the currently active call expanded. Completed calls remain collapsed until requested, while their call and result sections are available inside.
- Use motion only for active status indicators; completed and failed states must remain legible without animation.
