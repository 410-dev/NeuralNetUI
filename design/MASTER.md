# NeuralNetUI Design Language

## Principles

- Keep the chat itself visually dominant; controls should stay compact and quiet until needed.
- Use the dark neutral surface with restrained blue accents already established by the application.
- Reveal dense technical information progressively through clear, keyboard-accessible disclosure controls.
- Preserve readable vertical stacks on mobile and never require horizontal page scrolling.
- Keep settings categories in a horizontally scrollable tab row on narrow screens so every panel remains reachable without compressing its icon target.
- Group display-only preferences under Appearance; model identifiers and Markdown strikethrough are personal presentation choices.
- Present connections, models, and reasoning presets as reorderable selections with drag-and-drop plus adjacent up/down controls; the saved order must match the chat pickers.
- Limit drag initiation to dedicated handles whenever a reorderable item contains editable text or form controls.
- Keep long settings sidebars independently scrollable while the selected item's editor remains visible.
- Settings dialogs trap keyboard focus, make the background inert, close with Escape, and restore focus to the opener. Icon controls and switches have accessible names.

## Reasoning controls

- Generate built-in reasoning choices from model capabilities: Fast / Thinking for toggles, Fast plus advertised effort levels when supported; omit unsupported controls.
- Aliases display inherited capabilities as read-only. Custom templates retain prompt replacement, prepend, and append controls; their native selector offers only supported values.

## Residency and waiting

- Put the per-server resident-model limit and wait policy together in Connection settings; explain zero as unlimited.
- Show one localized, accessible status line in the assistant response area for session waiting, unloading, loading, server waiting, or response preparation. Preserve the stop action throughout waiting.
- Clear transient statuses when generation starts producing output or the job ends; never store them as conversation content.

## Tool activity

- Group all tool calls from one assistant message under one top-level disclosure with a wrench icon and aggregate state.
- Show every call as a subordinate disclosure with a tool-specific icon and localized active, completed, or error wording.
- Keep the top-level group collapsed by default. When the user opens it, keep the currently active call expanded and completed calls collapsed until requested.
- Match tool headings to the reasoning heading typography: unboxed icons, regular weight, and the same font sizing.
- Show localized tool-call markers only in the rendered reasoning view; never mix those markers into stored or upstream reasoning content.

## Selectable questions

- Present model questions above the composer rather than inside the technical tool disclosure.
- Show one question at a time and use a short horizontal slide transition between questions.
- Let the model choose single selection, multiple selection, or ranked selection according to the question.
- Render submitted question-and-answer pairs as right-aligned user message bubbles before the model continues.
- Keep the regular message composer visually secondary and unavailable while an answer is required.
- Keep generation cancellation available while a question is waiting; restore ordinary input when the task stops or is no longer available.
- Use motion only for active status indicators; completed and failed states must remain legible without animation.
